                    Hi, my name is Peter. I'm currently studying IT in Wroc≈Çaw. Since high school I've been passionate about web development. I enjoy learning new techniques and acquiring programming skills. I also put big effort on self-improvement. Constructive criticism is important for me, because I can learn a lot from my mistakes.
                </p>
                <p className='p-2 m-0'>
                    I'm quite social person despite being programmer. Spending time with different people and speaking to them is crucial part of my life. I'm interested in football, basketball and esports. Aditionally I love reading books no matter what type they are.
                </p>
